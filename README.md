# finance_rag_implementation
I use Retrieval Augmented Generation to produce accurate and specific answers from an LLM (ChatGPT) about the financial context of companies. This is done by feeding additional information into the model about the financial situation of the companies in question. I embed information from Yahoo Finance summaries and Yahoo Finance news headlines, and embed a user query about a specific company. Then I find similar chunks of information in the embedded vector space to the embedded query, and generate an answer by combining the query with the retrieved context chunks and feeding this to the LLM. This allows the LLM to produce a more accurate and relevant response to queries about the financial position of a company. The LLM was probably not trained with this information, especially recent news headlines, making this RAG approach valuable.
